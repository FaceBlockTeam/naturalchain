![logo](./assets/logo.png)  

## Description  

NaturalChain is an AI toolkit that brings the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to the blockchain. NaturalChain aims to revolutionize blockchain interaction by allowing users to utilize natural language commands to perform complex tasks.

NaturalChain was originally developed for the ETHGlobal Lisbon 2023 hackathon by the team at Cenit Finance along with Jes√∫s Ligero.

## Features

NaturalChain extends [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain). It uncludes tools includes that allow an AI agent to:

- Utilize the full JSON-RPC API from an EVM-compatible chain.
- Sign transactions
- Write and deploy smart contracts
- Query from APIs (The Graph, CoinMarketCap, etc.)

By default it uses ChatGPT 3.5, but you can hook it up to any LLM you wish.
